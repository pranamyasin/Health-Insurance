## HEALTH INSURANCE CLAIM DATASET

#### This project analyzes a health insurance claims dataset extracted from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yash9439/health-insurance-claims/data
#### The goal is to identify high-cost claim segments, evaluate risk factors, and prepare insights for dashboard visualization and decision-making.



### Key Insights
####  1. Regional Trends
##### * Highest average claim charges are observed in the Eastern/Southeast regions, followed by Western/Northwest regions.
##### * Applicants in these regions contribute disproportionately to total claims, especially smokers.

#### 2. Age & Demographics
##### * The majority of applicants are 18–64 years old.
##### * The average age of male and female applicants is similar, around 38 years.
##### * Average claim amounts increase with age:
  ##### * Under 30: lower average claims
  ##### *30–45: moderate
  ##### *46–60: higher
  ##### *60+: highest average claims

#### 3. BMI and Health Factors
##### * Applicants with higher BMI (Overweight/Obese) generally have higher claims.
##### * Average charges do not strictly increase with BMI; the highest individual claim was for an applicant with BMI ~47.
##### * BMI can be used as a risk indicator in combination with age and smoker status.

#### 4. Smoking Impact

##### * Smokers pay approximately 79.5% higher claims than non-smokers.
##### * Eastern regions have a higher proportion of smokers, contributing to higher regional claim amounts.


#### 5. Children & Dependents

##### * Average claims are highest for applicants with 3 children.
##### * Charges tend to decrease as the number of children increases, though exceptions exist.

#### 6. Charge Distribution
##### * Most claims fall within 2,000–5,000 units, followed by 5,000–10,000 and 10,000–20,000 ranges.
##### * A smaller number of high-cost claims (>20,000) disproportionately influence averages.

#### 7. High-Cost Claims
##### * The highest individual claim (~63,770 units) was made by a 54-year-old female smoker with BMI 47.41 and no children.
##### * High-cost claims are typically associated with older age, smoking, high BMI, and certain regions.
